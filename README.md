2. Make sure you have installed latest NodeJS LTS with npm.
3. Go to the LowSpecBot directory and create a file named `.env` and inside of it, create the environment variable `TOKEN` that will contain **YOUR TOKEN** (remember to use the bot one, since the user one isn't valid.).
4. Execute the following command in your terminal/console (by using cd to the LowSpecBot directory):  
   `npm install`  
   and next:  
   `node .`
5. 🎉 Congratulations! 🎉 The bot is now executing on your machine! 👏👏👏
