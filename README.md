**📖 Description:** Discord Bot whos purpose is to serve at LowSpecGuys Discord Server

## 📚 Made with:
* Discord API
* Discord JS (NodeJS)
* Discord Rich Presence

## 🏅 Accomplishments:
* Get the bot online ⮕ __Neutrovertido__
* Make the bot reply ⮕ __Neutrovertido__
* Set-up permissions and roles (__WIP__)

## ❓ How to:
__❗ IMPORTANT NOTE:__ The bot will only initialize with the proper token key, so you have to use your __OWN BOT TOKEN__ to use this code.
1. Clone repository / Download source code.
2. Make sure you have installed NodeJS 12 with npm.
3. Go to the LowSpecBot directory and create a file named `.env` and inside of it, create the environment variable `TOKEN` that will contain __YOUR TOKEN__ (remember to use the bot one, since the user one isn't valid.).
3. Execute the following command in your terminal/console (by using cd to the LowSpecBot directory):  
`npm install`  
and next:  
`node .`
4. 🎉 Congratulations! 🎉 The bot is now executing on your machine! 👏👏👏
